README -- Tk test suite design document.

This directory contains a set of validation tests for the Tk commands.
Please see the tests/README file in the Tcl source distribution for
information about the test suite.

It also holds tests for the testutils mechanism in the test file "testutils.test".
This mechanism supports Tk testing, but is not a part of Tk proper. Therefore, tests in
that test file have been constrained to not run by default. Please see the
explanation in "testutils.test" for how to run them.
